    <body onload="myFunction()">
        <!-- The event occurs when the user clicks on an element -->
        <p> 1. onclick demo </p>
        <p>Click the button to trigger a function that will output "Hello World" in a p element with id="demo".</p>
        <button onclick="myFunction()">Click me</button>
        <p id="demo"></p>
        
        <!--The event occurs when an element loses focus -->
        <p>2. onblur demo </p>
        Enter your name: <input type="text" id="fname" onblur="myFunction()">
        <p>When you leave the input field, a function is triggered which transforms the input text to upper case.</p>
        
        <!-- The event occurs when an error occurs with the event source -->
        <!-- An error usually occurs when a connection is disrupted. If this happens, the EventSource object will automatically attempt to reconnect to the server. -->
        <p>3. onerror demo </p>
        <img src="image.gif" onerror="myFunction()">
        <p>A function is triggered if an error occurs when loading the image. The function shows an alert box with a text.
        In this example we refer to an image that does not exist, therefore the onerror event occurs.</p>
        
        <!-- The event occurs when an object has loaded -->
        <!-- onload is most often used within the <body> element to execute a script once a web page has completely loaded all content (including images, script files, CSS files, etc.). -->
        <!-- The onload event can be used to check the visitor's browser type and browser version, and load the proper version of the web page based on the information. -->
        <p>4. onload demo</p>
        <h5>Page is loaded</h5>
        
        <!-- The event occurs when a form is submitted -->
        <p>5. onsubmit </p>
        <p>When you submit the form, a function is triggered which alerts some text.</p>
        <form action="Resume.html" onsubmit="myFunction()">
            Enter name: <input type="text" name="fname">
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>

        <!-- script starts -->
        <script>
            function myFunction() {
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World";
                var x = document.getElementById("fname");
                x.value = x.value.toUpperCase();
                alert('The image could not be loaded.');
                alert("Page is loaded");
                alert("The form was submitted");
